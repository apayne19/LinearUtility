# Economics Linear Utility Model
## Created by Alex Payne

### Interactive program to measure and graph continuity, concavity, and linearity of piecewise functions

* created in 2017 for an undergraduate economics course at George Mason University
* matplotlib, numpy, and sympy required

#### Step 1: Run Linear Utility.py

#### Step 2: Input your parameters
